# Multi-Label-Classification-Approach-to-predict-Clinical-Outcome-Measures

## 1. Project Background and Objectives

Clinical trials are studies intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new medical treatments or interventions (such as vaccines, dietary supplements, drugs, devices, and lifestyle modifications) on humans. Clinical trials used to be only conducted in-person at designated sites such as hospitals. However during the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic in 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued guidelines on how Sponsors could run clinical trials when participants could not physically attend protocol-specified visits, with suggestions including running trials remotely over the internet and collecting clinical outcomes using digital tools. These suggestions opened doors for Sponsors and Contract Research Organizations to reassess their conventional approach of running clinical trials.

This project uses a Multi Label Classification Model to investigate whether clinical trials with certain characteristics are more likely to adopt digital tools such as e-Questionnaire and e-Patient Diary to collect clinical outcome from paedaetrics. More than 10 years of industry-sponsored interventional paediatric clinical trial records were retrieved from ClinicalTrials.gov database and studied. A total of 27 MLC algorithms were implemented, and their performances were evaluated against example-based and label-based metrics.

## 2. Source of the dataset

The primary data used in this research is the clinical trial protocol information collected from [ClinicalTrials.gov,](https://clinicaltrials.gov/)], a publicly accessible global registry maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine. This registry contains more than 420 thousand clinical trial records documented since Year 2000. It is selected out of 17 other global registries primarily because it is the oldest and largest one. Also, this registry offers a RESTful Application Programming Interface (API) that provides convenient access to protocol information from computer programs.
